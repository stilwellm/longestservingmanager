Webpage that uses Javascript to sort PremierLeague managers by date of appointment. Small prject to help me learn Javascript and responsive webdesign.

Turnover of football managers in the English Premier League is pretty staggering. Apart from Arsene Wenger nobody has been in charge of their team for more than 4 years.

Decided to make a quick website that lists managers in order and displays number of days in charge.
